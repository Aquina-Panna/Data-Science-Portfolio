      "1Good evening from the Health Education Campus of Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Clinic. I’m Chris Wallace of Fox News and I welcome you to the first of the 2020 Presidential Debates between President Donald J. Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential debates. The Commission has designed the format, six roughly 15 minute segments with two minute answers from each candidate to the first question, then open discussion for the rest of each segment. Both campaigns have agreed to these rules. For the record, I decided the topics and the questions in each topic. I can assure you none of the questions has been shared with the Commission or the two candidates.\n",
      "2Chris Wallace: (02:10)\n",
      "3This debate is being conducted under health and safety protocols designed by the Cleveland Clinic, which is serving as the Health Security advisor to the Commission for all four debates. As a precaution, both campaigns have agreed the candidates will not shake hands at the beginning of tonight’s debate. The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent. No cheers, no boos, or other interruptions so we, and more importantly you, can focus on what the candidates have to say. No noise except right now, as we welcome the Republican nominee, President Trump, and the Democratic nominee Vice President Biden.\n",
      "4Vice President Joe Biden: (02:49)\n",
      "5How you doing, man?\n",
      "6President Donald J. Trump: (02:51)\n",
      "7How are you doing?\n",
      "8Vice President Joe Biden: (02:51)\n",
      "9I’m well.\n",
      "10Chris Wallace: (03:11)\n",
      "11Gentlemen, a lot of people been waiting for this night, so let’s get going. Our first subject is the Supreme Court. President Trump, you nominated Amy Coney Barrett over the weekend to succeed the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Court. You say the Constitution is clear about your obligation and the Senate’s to consider a nominee to the Court. Vice President Biden, you say that this is an effort by the President and Republicans to jam through on an appointment in what you call an abuse of power. My first question to both of you tonight, why are you right in the argument you make and your opponent wrong? And where do you think a Justice Barrett would take the court? President Trump, in this first segment, you go first. Two minutes.\n",
      "12President Donald J. Trump: (04:01)\n",
      "13Thank you very much, Chris. I will tell you very simply. We won the election. Elections have consequences. We have the Senate, we have the White House, and we have a phenomenal nominee respected by all. Top, top academic, good in every way. Good in every way. In fact, some of her biggest endorsers are very liberal people from Notre Dame and other places. So I think she’s going to be fantastic. We have plenty of time. Even if we did it after the election itself. I have a lot of time after the election, as you know. So I think that she will be outstanding. She’s going to be as good as anybody that has served on that court. We really feel that. We have a professor at Notre Dame, highly respected by all, said she’s the single greatest student he’s ever had. He’s been a professor for a long time at a great school.\n",
      "14President Donald J. Trump: (04:53)\n",
      "15And we won the election and therefore we have the right to choose her, and very few people knowingly would say otherwise. And by the way, the Democrats, they wouldn’t even think about not doing it. The only difference is they’d try and do it faster. There’s no way they would give it up. They had Merrick Garland, but the problem is they didn’t have the election so they were stopped. And probably that would happen in reverse, also. Definitely would happen in reverse. So we won the election and we have the right to do it, Chris.\n",
      "16Chris Wallace: (05:22)\n",
      "17President Trump, thank you. Same question to you, Vice President Biden. You have two minutes.\n",
      "18Vice President Joe Biden: (05:29)\n",
      "19Well, first of all, thank you for doing this and looking forward to this, Mr. President.\n",
      "20President Donald J. Trump: (05:34)\n",
      "21Thank you, Joe.\n",
      "22Vice President Joe Biden: (05:36)\n",
      "23The American people have a right to have a say in who the Supreme Court nominee is and that say occurs when they vote for United States Senators and when they vote for the President of United States. They’re not going to get that chance now because we’re in the middle of an election already. The election has already started. Tens of thousands of people already voted and so the thing that should happen is we should wait. We should wait and see what the outcome of this election is because that’s the only way the American people get to express their view is by who they elect as President and who they elect as Vice President.\n",
      "24Vice President Joe Biden: (06:12)\n",
      "25Now, what’s at stake here is the President’s made it clear, he wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. He’s been running on that, he ran on that and he’s been governing on that. He’s in the Supreme Court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which will strip 20 million people from having health insurance now, if it goes into court. And the justice, I’m not opposed to the justice, she seems like a very fine person. But she’s written, before she went in the bench, which is her right, that she thinks that the Affordable Care Act is not Constitutional. The other thing that’s on the court, and if it’s struck down, what happens? Women’s rights are fundamentally changed. Once again, a woman could pay more money because she has a pre-existing condition of pregnancy. They’re able to charge women more for the same exact procedure a man gets.\n",
      "26Vice President Joe Biden: (07:08)\n",
      "27And that ended when we, in fact, passed the Affordable Care Act, and there’s a hundred million people who have pre-existing conditions and they’ll be taken away as well. Those pre-existing conditions, insurance companies are going to love this. And so it’s just not appropriate to do this before this election. If he wins the election and the Senate is Republican, then he goes forward. If not, we should wait until February.\n",
      "28President Donald J. Trump: (07:34)\n",
      "29There aren’t a hundred million people with pre-existing conditions. As far as a say is concerned, the people already had their say. Okay, Justice Ginsburg said very powerfully, very strongly, at some point 10 years ago or so, she said a President and the Senate is elected for a period of time, but a President is elected for four years. We’re not elected for three years. I’m not elected for three years. So we have the Senate, we have a President-\n",
      "30Vice President Joe Biden: (08:01)\n",
      "31He’s elected to the next election.\n",
      "32President Donald J. Trump: (08:02)\n",
      "33During that period of time, during that period of time, we have an opening. I’m not elected for three years. I’m elected for four years. Joe, the hundred million people is totally wrong. I don’t know where you got that number. The bigger problem that you have is that you’re going to extinguish 180 million people with their private health care, that they’re very happy this.\n",
      "34Vice President Joe Biden: (08:24)\n",
      "35That’s simply not true.\n",
      "36President Donald J. Trump: (08:25)\n",
      "37Well, you’re certainly going to socialist. You’re going to socialist medicine-\n",
      "38Chris Wallace: (08:29)\n",
      "39Gentlemen, we’re now into open discussion.\n",
      "40Vice President Joe Biden: (08:31)\n",
      "41Open discussion.\n",
      "42Chris Wallace: (08:32)\n",
      "43Open discussion, yes, I agree. Go ahead, Vice President.\n",
      "44Vice President Joe Biden: (08:33)\n",
      "45Number one, he knows what I proposed. What I proposed is that we expand Obamacare and we increase it. We do not wipe any. And one of the big debates we had with 23 of my colleagues trying to win the nomination that I won, were saying that Biden wanted to allow people to have private insurance still. They can. They do. They will under my proposal.\n",
      "46President Donald J. Trump: (08:58)\n",
      "47That’s not what you’ve said and it’s not what your party is saying.\n",
      "48Vice President Joe Biden: (09:00)\n",
      "49That is simply a lie.\n",
      "50President Donald J. Trump: (09:02)\n",
      "51Your party doesn’t say it. Your party wants to go socialist medicine and socialist healthcare.\n",
      "52Vice President Joe Biden: (09:05)\n",
      "53The party is me. Right now, I am the Democratic Party.\n",
      "54President Donald J. Trump: (09:08)\n",
      "55And they’re going to dominate you, Joe. You know that.\n",
      "56Vice President Joe Biden: (09:09)\n",
      "57I am the Democratic Party right now.\n",
      "58President Donald J. Trump: (09:11)\n",
      "59Not according to Harris.\n",
      "60Vice President Joe Biden: (09:12)\n",
      "61The platform of the Democratic Party is what I, in fact, approved of, what I approved of. Now, here’s the deal. The deal is that it’s going to wipe out pre-existing conditions. And, by the way, the 20, the 200 mil- the 200,000 people that have died on his watch, how many of those have survived? Well, there’s seven million people that contracted COVID. What does it mean for them going forward if you strike down the Affordable Care Act?\n",
      "62President Donald J. Trump: (09:39)\n",
      "63Joe, you’ve had 308,000 military people dying because you couldn’t provide them proper healthcare in the military. So don’t tell me about this.\n",
      "64Vice President Joe Biden: (09:47)\n",
      "65I’m happy to talk about this.\n",
      "66President Donald J. Trump: (09:48)\n",
      "67And if you were here, it wouldn’t be 200, it would be two million people because you were very late on the draw. You didn’t want me to ban China, which was heavily infected. You didn’t want me to ban Europe.\n",
      "68Chris Wallace: (09:58)\n",
      "69All right, gentlemen, Mr. President.\n",
      "70President Donald J. Trump: (10:00)\n",
      "71You would have been much later, Joe, much later.\n",
      "72Chris Wallace: (10:04)\n",
      "73Mr. President.\n",
      "74President Donald J. Trump: (10:04)\n",
      "75We’re talking about two million people.\n",
      "76Vice President Joe Biden: (10:05)\n",
      "77You’re not going to be able to shut him up.\n",
      "78Chris Wallace: (10:06)\n",
      "79Mr. President, as the moderator, we are going to talk about COVID in the next segment. But go ahead.\n",
      "80Vice President Joe Biden: (10:11)\n",
      "81Let me finish. The point is that the President also is opposed to Roe V. Wade. That’s on the ballot as well and the court, in the court, and so that’s also at stake right now. And so the election is all-\n",
      "82President Donald J. Trump: (10:25)\n",
      "83You don’t know what’s on the ballot. Why is it on the ballot? Why is it on the ballot? It’s not on the ballot.\n",
      "84Vice President Joe Biden: (10:31)\n",
      "85It’s on the ballot in the court.\n",
      "86President Donald J. Trump: (10:32)\n",
      "87I don’t think so.\n",
      "88Vice President Joe Biden: (10:33)\n",
      "89In the court.\n",
      "90President Donald J. Trump: (10:34)\n",
      "91There’s nothing happening there.\n",
      "92Vice President Joe Biden: (10:35)\n",
      "93Donald would you just be quiet for a minute.\n",
      "94President Donald J. Trump: (10:36)\n",
      "95You don’t know her view on Roe V. Wade? You don’t know here view.\n",
      "96Chris Wallace: (10:40)\n",
      "97Well, all right. All right. Let’s talk. We’ve got a lot to unpack here, gentlemen. We’ve got a lot of time. On healthcare, and then we’ll come back to Roe V. Wade.\n",
      "98Vice President Joe Biden: (10:51)\n",
      "99All right.\n",
      "100Chris Wallace: (10:51)\n",
      "101Mr. President, the Supreme Court will hear a case a week after the election in which the Trump Administration, along with 18 state Attorney Generals are seeking to overturn Obamacare, to end Obamacare.\n",
      "102President Donald J. Trump: (11:05)\n",
      "103That’s right.\n",
      "104Chris Wallace: (11:05)\n",
      "105You have spent the last week-\n",
      "106President Donald J. Trump: (11:07)\n",
      "107Because they want to give good healthcare.\n",
      "108Chris Wallace: (11:08)\n",
      "109If I may ask my question, sir.\n",
      "110Vice President Joe Biden: (11:11)\n",
      "111Good healthcare.\n",
      "112Chris Wallace: (11:11)\n",
      "113Over the last four years, you have promised to repeal and replace Obamacare, but you have never in these four years come up with a plan, a comprehensive plan, to replace Obamacare.\n",
      "114President Donald J. Trump: (11:25)\n",
      "115Yes, I have. Of course, I have. The individual mandate.\n",
      "116Chris Wallace: (11:26)\n",
      "117 when I finish I’m going to give an opportunity-\n",
      "118President Donald J. Trump: (11:28)\n",
      "119Excuse me. I got rid of the individual mandate, which was a big chunk of Obamacare.\n",
      "120Chris Wallace: (11:31)\n",
      "121That’s not a comprehensive place.\n",
      "122President Donald J. Trump: (11:32)\n",
      "123That is absolutely a big thing. That was the worst part of Obamacare.\n",
      "124Chris Wallace: (11:35)\n",
      "125I didn’t ask, sir.\n",
      "126President Donald J. Trump: (11:36)\n",
      "127Chris, that was the worst part of Obamacare.\n",
      "128Chris Wallace: (11:38)\n",
      "129You’re debating him not me. Let me ask my question.\n",
      "130President Donald J. Trump: (11:38)\n",
      "131Well, I’ll ask Joe. The individual mandate was the most unpopular aspect of Obamacare.\n",
      "132Chris Wallace: (11:44)\n",
      "133Mr. President.\n",
      "134President Donald J. Trump: (11:44)\n",
      "135I got rid of it. And we will protect people.\n",
      "136Chris Wallace: (11:46)\n",
      "137Mr. President, I’m the moderator of this debate and I would like you to let me ask my question and then you can answer.\n",
      "138President Donald J. Trump: (11:52)\n",
      "139Go ahead.\n",
      "140Chris Wallace: (11:53)\n",
      "141You, in the course of these four years, have never come up with a comprehensive plan to replace Obamacare, and just this last Thursday you signed a largely symbolic Executive Order to protect people with pre-existing conditions five days before this debate. So my question, sir, is what is the Trump healthcare plan?\n",
      "142President Donald J. Trump: (12:16)\n",
      "143Well, first of all, I guess I’m debating you, not him, but that’s okay. I’m not surprised. Let me just tell you something. There’s nothing symbolic. I’m cutting drug prices. I’m going with Favored Nations, which no President has the courage to do because you’re going against big pharma. Drug prices will be coming down 80 or 90%. You could have done it during your 47 year period in government, but you didn’t do it. Nobody’s done it. So we’re cutting healthcare.\n",
      "144Chris Wallace: (12:40)\n",
      "145What about pre-existing conditions?\n",
      "146President Donald J. Trump: (12:40)\n",
      "147All of the things that we’ve done.\n",
      "148Vice President Joe Biden: (12:41)\n",
      "149He has not done healthcare.\n",
      "150President Donald J. Trump: (12:42)\n",
      "151I’ll give you an example. Insulin, it was destroying families, destroying people, the cost. I’m getting it for so cheap it’s like water, you want to know the truth. So cheap. Take a look at all of the drugs that what we’re doing. Prescription drug prices, we’re going to allow our Governors now to go to other countries to buy drugs because when they paid just a tiny fraction of what we do.\n",
      "152Chris Wallace: (13:03)\n",
      "153Okay, like I say, this is open discussion.\n",
      "154President Donald J. Trump: (13:04)\n",
      "155This is big stuff.\n",
      "156Chris Wallace: (13:06)\n",
      "157Sir, you’ll be happy. I’m about to pick up on one of your points to ask the Vice President, which is, he points out that you would like to add a public option to Obamacare.\n",
      "158Vice President Joe Biden: (13:17)\n",
      "159Yes.\n",
      "160Chris Wallace: (13:17)\n",
      "161And the argument that he makes and other Republicans make is that that is going to end private insurance.\n",
      "162Vice President Joe Biden: (13:23)\n",
      "163It is not.\n",
      "164Chris Wallace: (13:25)\n",
      "165If I start asking the question.\n",
      "166President Donald J. Trump: (13:26)\n",
      "167That’s not what your party says, by the way.\n",
      "168Chris Wallace: (13:29)\n",
      "169And it will end private insurance and create a government takeover of health.\n",
      "170Vice President Joe Biden: (13:32)\n",
      "171It does not. It’s only for those people who are so poor they qualify for Medicaid they can get that free in most States, except Governors who want to deny people who are poor Medicaid. Anyone who qualifies for Medicare, excuse me, Medicaid would automatically be enrolled in the public option. The vast majority of the American people would still not be in that option. Number one. Number two.\n",
      "172President Donald J. Trump: (13:57)\n",
      "173Joe, you agreed with Bernie Sanders, who’s far left, on the manifesto, we call it. And that gives you socialized medicine.\n",
      "174Vice President Joe Biden: (14:04)\n",
      "175Look, hey.\n",
      "176President Donald J. Trump: (14:05)\n",
      "177Are you saying you didn’t agree?\n",
      "178Vice President Joe Biden: (14:06)\n",
      "179I’m not going to listen to him. The fact of the matter is I beat Bernie Sanders.\n",
      "180President Donald J. Trump: (14:10)\n",
      "181Not by much.\n",
      "182Vice President Joe Biden: (14:10)\n",
      "183I beat him by a whole hell of a lot.\n",
      "184President Donald J. Trump: (14:12)\n",
      "185Not by much.\n",
      "186Vice President Joe Biden: (14:12)\n",

      "194Vice President Joe Biden: (14:21)\n",
      "195Look he’s the deal. I got very lucky. I’m going to get very lucky tonight as well.\n",
      "196President Donald J. Trump: (14:23)\n",
      "197With what?\n",
      "198Vice President Joe Biden: (14:23)\n",

      "201With what?\n",
      "202Vice President Joe Biden: (14:25)\n",
      "203Because here’s the deal, here’s the deal. The fact is that everything he’s saying so far is simply a lie. I’m not here to call out his lies. Everybody knows he’s a liar.\n",
      "204President Donald J. Trump: (14:34)\n",

      "208Chris Wallace: (14:43)\n",
      "209Mr. President, can you let him finish, sir?\n",
      "210Vice President Joe Biden: (14:44)\n",
      "211No, he doesn’t know how to do that.\n",
      "212President Donald J. Trump: (14:46)\n",
      "213You’d be surprised. You’d be surprised. Go ahead, Joe.\n",

      "215The wrong guy, the wrong night, at the wrong time.\n",
      "216President Donald J. Trump: (14:51)\n",
      "217Listen, you agreed with Bernie Sanders and the manifesto.\n",
      "218Vice President Joe Biden: (14:55)\n",
      "219There is no manifesto, number one.\n",
      "220Chris Wallace: (14:57)\n",
      "221Please let him speak, Mr. President.\n",
      "222Vice President Joe Biden: (14:58)\n",
      "223Number two.\n",
      "224President Donald J. Trump: (14:58)\n",

      "227Number two.\n",
      "228President Donald J. Trump: (15:01)\n",
      "229You just lost the left. You agreed with Bernie Sanders on a plan that you absolutely agreed to and under that plan , they call it socialized medicine.\n",

      "231Mr. President.\n",
      "232Vice President Joe Biden: (15:14)\n",
      "233I’ll tell you what, he is not for any help for people needing healthcare.\n",
      "234President Donald J. Trump: (15:20)\n",
      "235Who is, Bernie?\n",
      "236Vice President Joe Biden: (15:21)\n",
      "237Because he, in fact, already has costs 10 million people their healthcare that they had from their employers because of his recession. Number one. Number two, there are 20 million people getting healthcare through Obamacare now that he wants to take it away. He won’t ever look you in the eye and say that’s what he wants to do. Take it away.\n",
      "238President Donald J. Trump: (15:41)\n",
      "239No, I want to give them better healthcare at a much lower price, because Obamacare is no good.\n",
      "240Vice President Joe Biden: (15:45)\n",
      "241He doesn’t know how. He doesn’t know how to do that.\n",
      "242President Donald J. Trump: (15:46)\n",
      "243I’ve already fixed it.\n",
      "244Vice President Joe Biden: (15:47)\n",
      "245He has never offered a plan.\n",
      "246President Donald J. Trump: (15:49)\n",
      "247We’ve already fixed it to an extent. Obamacare, as you might know but probably don’t, Obamacare is no good.\n",
      "248Chris Wallace: (15:54)\n",
      "249Gentlemen, you realize if you’re both speaking at the same time. Let the President. Go ahead, sir.\n",
      "250President Donald J. Trump: (15:59)\n",
      "251Obamacare is no good. We made it better and I had a choice to make very early on. We took away the individual mandate. We guaranteed pre-existing conditions, but took away the individual mandate. Listen, this is the way it is. And that destroyed … They shouldn’t even call it Obamacare, then I had a choice to make, do I let my people run it really well or badly? If I run it badly, they’ll probably blame him, but they’ll blame me. But more importantly, I want to help people. Okay. I said, “You’ve got to run it so well.” And I just had a meeting with them. They said the problem is, no matter how well you run Obamacare, it’s a disaster. It’s too expensive. Premiums are too high, that it doesn’t work. So we do want to get rid of it. Chris, we want to get rid of that and give something that’s cheaper and better.\n",
      "252Chris Wallace: (16:42)\n",
      "253I understand that, sir. But I have to give you roughly equal time.\n",
      "254President Donald J. Trump: (16:45)\n",
      "255Go ahead.\n",
      "256Chris Wallace: (16:45)\n",
      "257Please let the Vice President talk, sir.\n",
      "258President Donald J. Trump: (16:47)\n",
      "259Good.\n",
      "260Vice President Joe Biden: (16:48)\n",
      "261He has no plan for healthcare.\n",
      "262President Donald J. Trump: (16:50)\n",
      "263Of course, we do.\n",
      "264Chris Wallace: (16:52)\n",
      "265Please.\n",
      "266Vice President Joe Biden: (16:52)\n",
      "267He sends out wishful thinking. He has Executive Orders that have no power. He hasn’t lowered drug costs for anybody. He’s been promising a healthcare plan since he got elected. He has none, like almost everything else he talks about. He does not have a plan. He doesn’t have a plan. And the fact is this man doesn’t know what he’s talking about. .\n",
      "268Chris Wallace: (17:13)\n",
      "269All right, I have one final question for you.\n",
      "270Vice President Joe Biden: (17:15)\n",
      "271Sure.\n",
      "272Chris Wallace: (17:16)\n",
      "273Mr. Vice President, if Senate Republicans, we were talking originally about the Supreme Court here, if Senate Republicans go ahead and confirm Justice Barrett there has been talk about ending the filibuster or even packing the court, adding to the nine justices there. You call this a distraction by the President. But, in fact, it wasn’t brought up by the President. It was brought up by some of your Democratic colleagues in the Congress. So my question to you is, you have refused in the past to talk about it, are you willing to tell the American tonight whether or not you will support either ending the filibuster or packing the court?\n",
      "274Vice President Joe Biden: (17:55)\n",
      "275Whatever position I take on that, that’ll become the issue. The issue is the American people should speak. You should go out and vote. You’re voting now. Vote and let your Senators know strongly how you feel.\n",
      "276President Donald J. Trump: (18:05)\n",
      "277Are you going to pack the court?\n",
      "278Vice President Joe Biden: (18:07)\n",
      "279Vote now.\n",
      "280President Donald J. Trump: (18:08)\n",
      "281Are you going to pack the court?\n",
      "282Vice President Joe Biden: (18:09)\n",
      "283Make sure you, in fact, let people know, your Senators.\n",
      "284President Donald J. Trump: (18:12)\n",
      "285He doesn’t want to answer the question.\n",
      "286Vice President Joe Biden: (18:17)\n",
      "287I’m not going to answer the question.\n",
      "288President Donald J. Trump: (18:18)\n",
      "289Why wouldn’t you answer that question? You want to put a lot of new Supreme Court Justices. Radical left.\n",
      "290Vice President Joe Biden: (18:18)\n",
      "291Will you shut up, man?\n",
      "292President Donald J. Trump: (18:20)\n",
      "293Listen, who is on your list, Joe? Who’s on your list?\n",
      "294Chris Wallace: (18:23)\n",
      "295Gentlemen, I think we’ve ended this-\n",
      "296Vice President Joe Biden: (18:25)\n",
      "297This is so un-Presidential.\n",
      "298President Donald J. Trump: (18:25)\n",
      "299He’s going to pack the court. He is not going to give a list.\n",
      "300Chris Wallace: (18:27)\n",
      "301We have ended the segment. We’re going to move on to the second segment.\n",
      "302Vice President Joe Biden: (18:30)\n",
      "303That was really a productive segment, wasn’t it? Keep yapping, man.\n",
      "304President Donald J. Trump: (18:35)\n",
      "305The people understand, Joe.\n",
      "306Vice President Joe Biden: (18:37)\n",
      "307They sure do.\n",
      "308President Donald J. Trump: (18:37)\n",
      "30947 years, you’ve done nothing. They’re understand.\n",
      "310Chris Wallace: (18:40)\n",
      "311All right, the second subject is COVID-19, which is an awfully serious subject. So let’s try to be serious about it. We have had more than seven million cases of coronavirus in the United States and more than 200,000 people have died. Even after we produce a vaccine, experts say that it could be months or even years before we come back to anything approaching normal. My question for both of you is, based on what you have said and done so far, and what you have said you would do starting in 2021, why should the American people trust you more than your opponent to deal with this public health crisis going forward? In this case, the question goes to you first, sir. Two minutes, uninterrupted.\n",
      "312Vice President Joe Biden: (19:33)\n",
      "313Good luck. 200,000 dead. As you said, over seven million infected in the United States. We, in fact, have 4% of the world’s population, 20% of the deaths. 40,000 people a day are contracting COVID. In addition to that, about between 750 and 1000 people a day are dying. When he was presented with that number, he said, “It is what it is.” Well, it is what it is because you are who you are. That’s why it is. The President has no plan. He hasn’t laid out anything. He knew all the way back in February how serious this crisis was. He knew it was a deadly disease. What did he do? He’s on tape as acknowledging he knew it. He said he didn’t tell us or give people a warning of it because he didn’t want to panic the American people. You don’t panic. He panicked. In addition to that, what did he do?\n",
      "314Vice President Joe Biden: (20:30)\n",
      "315He went in and we were insisting that the people we had in the ground in China should be able to go to Wuhan and determine for themselves how dangerous this was. He did not even ask Xi to do that.\n",
      "316President Donald J. Trump: (20:43)\n",
      "317Wrong.\n",
      "318Vice President Joe Biden: (20:43)\n",
      "319He told us what a great job Xi was doing. He said we owe him debt of gratitude for being so transparent with us. And what did he do then? He then did nothing. He waited and waited and waited. He still doesn’t have a plan.\n",
      "320President Donald J. Trump: (20:57)\n",
      "321Wrong.\n",
      "322Chris Wallace: (20:57)\n",
      "323Sir, it’s his two minutes.\n",
      "324President Donald J. Trump: (20:57)\n",
      "325It’s so wrong.\n",
      "326Vice President Joe Biden: (20:57)\n",
      "327I laid out back in March, exactly what we should be doing. And I laid out again in July, what we should be doing. We should be providing all the protective gear possible. We should be providing the money the House has passed in order to be able to go out and get people the help they need to keep their businesses open. Open schools cost a lot of money. You should get out of your bunker and get out of the sand trap in your golf course and go in the Oval Office and bring together the Democrats and Republicans and fund what needs to be done now to save lives.\n",
      "328President Donald J. Trump: (21:30)\n",
      "329So, if we would have listened to you.\n",
      "330Chris Wallace: (21:31)\n",
      "331Wait, wait. You have two minutes, sir.\n",
      "332President Donald J. Trump: (21:31)\n",
      "333If we would’ve listened to you, the country would have been left wide open, millions of people would have died, not 200,000. And one person is too much. It’s China’s fault. It should have never happened. They stopped it from going in, but it was China’s fault. And, by the way, when you talk about numbers, you don’t know how many people died in China. You don’t know how many people died in Russia. You don’t know how many people died in India. They don’t exactly give you a straight count, just so you understand. But if you look at what we’ve done, I closed it and you said, “He’s xenophobic. He’s a racist and he’s xenophobic,” because you didn’t think I should have closed our country. Wait a minute.\n",
      "334Chris Wallace: (22:06)\n",
      "335Sir, it’s his two minutes.\n",
      "336President Donald J. Trump: (22:07)\n",
      "337You didn’t think we should have closed our country because you thought it was terrible. You wouldn’t have closed it for another two months. By my doing it early, in fact, Dr. Fauci said, “President Trump saved thousands of lives.” Many of your Democrat Governors said, “President Trump did a phenomenal job.” We worked with the Governor. Oh really, go take a look. The Governors said I did a phenomenal job. Most of them said that. In fact, people that would not be necessarily on my side said that, “President Trump did a phenomenal job.” We did. We got the gowns. We got the masks. We made the ventilators. You wouldn’t have made ventilators. And now we’re weeks away from a vaccine. We’re doing therapeutics already. Fewer people are dying when they get sick. Far fewer people are dying. We’ve done a great job.\n",
      "338President Donald J. Trump: (22:54)\n",
      "339The only thing I haven’t done a good job, and that’s because of the fake news, no matter what you say to them, they give you a bad press on it. It’s just fake news. They give you good press, they give me bad press because that’s the way it is, unfortunately. But let me just say something. I don’t care. I’ve gotten used to it. But I’ll tell you, Joe, you could never have done the job that we did. You don’t have it in your blood. You could’ve never done that, Joe.\n",
      "340Vice President Joe Biden: (23:15)\n",
      "341I know how to do the job. I know how to get the job done.\n",
      "342President Donald J. Trump: (23:18)\n",
      "343Well, you didn’t do very well in Swine Flu. H1-N1, you were a disaster. Your own Chief of Staff said you were a disaster.\n",
      "344Vice President Joe Biden: (23:25)\n",
      "34514,000 people died, not 200,000.\n",
      "346President Donald J. Trump: (23:27)\n",
      "347A far less lethal disease, by the way.\n",
      "348Chris Wallace: (23:32)\n",
      "349Sir, you made a point. Let him answer it.\n",
      "350Vice President Joe Biden: (23:33)\n",
      "351And there was no one … We didn’t shut down the economy. This is his economy he shut down. The reason it’s shut down is because, look, you folks at home. How many of you got up this morning and had an empty chair at the kitchen table because someone died of COVID? How many of you are in a situation where you lost your mom or dad and you couldn’t even speak to them, you had a nurse holding a phone up so you could in fact say goodbye?\n",
      "352President Donald J. Trump: (23:57)\n",
      "353We would have lost far more people, far more people. You would have been months late. You’re months behind me, Joe.\n",
      "354Vice President Joe Biden: (24:03)\n",
      "355His own CDC Director says we could lose as many as another 200,000 people between now and the end of the year. And he said, if we just wear a mask, we can save half those numbers. Just a mask. And by the way, in terms of the whole notion of a vaccine, we’re for a vaccine, but I don’t trust him at all. Nor do you. I know you don’t. What we trust is a scientist.\n",
      "356President Donald J. Trump: (24:25)\n",
      "357You don’t trust Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer?\n",
      "358Chris Wallace:\n",
      "359Okay, gentlemen, gentlemen. Let me move on to questions about the future because you both have touched on two of the questions I’m going to ask. Focusing on the future first, President Trump, you have repeatedly either contradicted or been at odds with some of your governments own top scientists. The week before last, the Head of the Centers for Disease Control, Dr. Redfield said it would be summer before the vaccine would become generally available to the public. You said that he was confused and mistaken. Those were your two words. But Dr. Slaoui, the head of your Operation Warp Speed, has said exactly the same thing. Are they both wrong?\n",
      "360President Donald J. Trump: (00:15)\n",
      "361Well, I’ve spoken to the companies and we can have it a lot sooner. It’s a very political thing because people like this would rather make it political than save lives.\n",
      "362Vice President Joe Biden: (00:22)\n",
      "363God.\n",
      "364President Donald J. Trump: (00:23)\n",
      "365It is a very political thing. I’ve spoken to Pfizer, I’ve spoken to all of the people that you have to speak to, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and others. They can go faster than that by a lot. It’s become very political because the left… Or I don’t know if I call them left, I don’t know what I call them.\n",
      "366Chris Wallace: (00:38)\n",
      "367So you’re suggesting that the head of your Operation Warp Speed, Dr. Slaoui-\n",
      "368President Donald J. Trump: (00:42)\n",
      "369I disagree with him. No, I disagree with both of them. And he didn’t say that. He said it could be there, but it could also be much sooner. I had him in my office two days ago.\n",
      "370Chris Wallace: (00:49)\n",
      "371He talked about the summer, sir, before it’s generally available, just like Dr. Redfield.\n",
      "372President Donald J. Trump: (00:53)\n",
      "373Because he said it’s a possibility that we’ll have the answer before November 1st. It could also be after that.\n",
      "374Chris Wallace: (00:59)\n",
      "375I’m talking about when it’s generally available, not-\n",
      "376President Donald J. Trump: (01:00)\n",
      "377Well, we’re going to deliver it right away. We have the military all set up. Logistically, they’re all set up. We have our military that delivers soldiers and they can do 200,000 a day. They’re going to be delivering-\n",
      "378Vice President Joe Biden: (01:11)\n",
      "379This is the same man who told you-\n",
      "380President Donald J. Trump: (01:13)\n",
      "381It’s all set up.\n",
      "382Vice President Joe Biden: (01:14)\n",
      "383… by Easter, this would be gone away. By the warm weather, it’d be gone. Miraculous, like a miracle. And by the way, maybe you could inject some bleach in your arm, and that would take care of it. This is the same man.\n",
      "384President Donald J. Trump: (01:24)\n",
      "385That was said sarcastically, and you know that. That was said sarcastically.\n",
      "386Vice President Joe Biden: (01:28)\n",
      "387So here’s the deal. This man is talking about a vaccine. Every serious company is talking about maybe having a vaccine done by the end of the year, but the distribution of that vaccine will not occur until sometime beginning of the middle of next year to get it out, if we get the vaccine. And pray God we will. Pray God we will.\n",
      "388Chris Wallace: (01:49)\n",
      "389Mr. Vice President, I want to pick up-\n",
      "390President Donald J. Trump: (01:50)\n",
      "391You’ll have the vaccine sooner than that.\n",
      "392Chris Wallace: (01:51)\n",
      "393I want to pick up on this question though. You say the public can trust the scientists, but they can’t trust President Trump. In fact, you said that again tonight. Your running mate, Senator Harris, goes further, saying that public health experts quote, “Will be muzzled, will be suppressed.” Given the fact that polls already show that people are concerned about the vaccine and are reluctant to take it, are you and your running mate, Senator Harris, contributing to that fear?\n",
      "394Vice President Joe Biden: (02:18)\n",
      "395No more than the question you just asked him. You pointed out he puts pressure and disagrees with his own scientists.\n",
      "396Chris Wallace: (02:25)\n",
      "397But you’re saying you can’t-\n",
      "398Vice President Joe Biden: (02:26)\n",
      "399Everybody knows-\n",
      "400Chris Wallace: (02:26)\n",
      "401Or Senator Harris is saying you can’t trust the scientist.\n",
      "402Vice President Joe Biden: (02:28)\n",
      "403Well, no, no. You can trust the scientist. She didn’t say that. You can trust the-\n",
      "404Chris Wallace: (02:32)\n",
      "405She said that public health experts quote, “Will be muzzled, will be suppressed.”\n",
      "406Vice President Joe Biden: (02:36)\n",
      "407Yes. Well, that’s what he’s going to try to do, but there’s thousands of scientists out there, like here at this great hospital that don’t work for him. Their job doesn’t depend on him. They’re the people… And by the way-\n",
      "408President Donald J. Trump: (02:51)\n",
      "409We spoke to the scientists that are in charge-\n",
      "410Vice President Joe Biden: (02:53)\n",
      "411By the way-\n",
      "412President Donald J. Trump: (02:53)\n",
      "413… they will have the vaccine very soon.\n",
      "414Chris Wallace: (02:55)\n",
      "415Let him finish.\n",
      "416Vice President Joe Biden: (02:55)\n",
      "417Do you believe for a moment what he’s telling you in light of all the lies he’s told you about the whole issue relating to COVID? He still hasn’t even acknowledged that he knew this was happening, knew how dangerous it was going to be back in February, and he didn’t even tell you. He’s on record as saying it. He panicked or he just looked at the stock market. One of the two. Because guess what? A lot of people died and a lot more are going to die unless he gets a lot smarter, a lot quicker-\n",
      "418Chris Wallace: (03:27)\n",
      "419Mr. President?\n",
      "420President Donald J. Trump: (03:28)\n",
      "421Did you use the word smart? So you said you went to Delaware State, but you forgot the name of your college. You didn’t go to Delaware State. You graduated either the lowest or almost the lowest in your class. Don’t ever use the word smart with me. Don’t ever use that word.\n",
      "422Vice President Joe Biden: (03:44)\n",
      "423Oh, give me a break.\n",
      "424President Donald J. Trump: (03:44)\n",
      "425Because you know what? There’s nothing smart about you, Joe. 47 years you’ve done nothing.\n",
      "426Vice President Joe Biden: (03:49)\n",
      "427Well, let’s have this debate-\n",
      "428President Donald J. Trump: (03:51)\n",
      "429Let me just tell you something, Joe. If you would have had the charge of what I was put through, I had to close the greatest economy of the history of our country. And by the way, now it’s being built again and it’s going up fast.\n",
      "430Chris Wallace: (04:02)\n",
      "431We’ll get to the economy in the next segment, sir.\n",
      "432President Donald J. Trump: (04:04)\n",
      "433Okay. It’s going up fast. I look forward to talking about it.\n",
      "434Chris Wallace: (04:06)\n",
      "435Okay. When it comes to how the virus has been handled so far, the two of you have taken very different approaches, and this is going to affect how the virus is handled going forward by whichever of you ends up becoming the next president. I want to quickly go through several of those. Reopenings. Vice President Biden, you have been much more reluctant than President Trump about reopening the economy and schools. Why, sir?\n",
      "436Vice President Joe Biden: (04:31)\n",
      "437Because he doesn’t have a plan. If I were running it, I’d know what the plan is. You’ve got to provide these businesses the ability to have the money to be able to reopen with the PPE, as well as with the sanitation they need. You have to provide them classic-\n",
      "438President Donald J. Trump: (04:45)\n",
      "439Tell that to Nancy Pelosi.\n",
      "440Vice President Joe Biden: (04:47)\n",
      "441Will he just shush for a minute?\n",
      "442President Donald J. Trump: (04:49)\n",
      "443Tell that to Nancy Pelosi, and Schumer  Chuck.\n",
      "444Vice President Joe Biden: (04:52)\n",
      "445Nancy Pelosi and Schumer, they have a plan. He won’t even meet with them. The Republicans won’t meet in the Senate. He sits in his golf course. Well, I mean, literally, think about it. Think about it.\n",
      "446President Donald J. Trump: (05:04)\n",
      "447You probably play more than I do, Joe.\n",
      "448Chris Wallace: (05:06)\n",
      "449What about this question of reopenings and the fact-\n",
      "450President Donald J. Trump: (05:08)\n",
      "451Well, he wants to shut down this country and I want to keep it open, and we did a great thing by shutting it down-\n",
      "452Vice President Joe Biden: (05:15)\n",
      "453You just admitted you’d shut it down.\n",
      "454President Donald J. Trump: (05:15)\n",
      "455Wait a minute, Joe. Let me shut you down for a second, Joe, just for one second. He wants to shut down the country. We just went through it. We had to, because we didn’t know anything about the disease. Now we’ve found that elderly people with heart problems and diabetes and different problems are very, very vulnerable. We learned a lot. Young children aren’t, even younger people aren’t. We’ve learned a lot, but he wants to shut it down. More people will be hurt by continuing. If you look at Pennsylvania, if you look at certain states that have been shut down, they have Democrat governors, all, one of the reasons they shut down is because they want to keep it shut down until after the election on November 3rd.\n",
      "456Chris Wallace: (05:54)\n",
      "457All right. I want to move onto another-\n",
      "458President Donald J. Trump: (05:55)\n",
      "459Because it’s a political thing.\n",
      "460Chris Wallace: (05:55)\n",
      "461I want to move onto another subject.\n",
      "462Vice President Joe Biden: (05:55)\n",
      "463I got to respond to that.\n",
      "464Chris Wallace: (05:55)\n",
      "465I want to move-\n",
      "466President Donald J. Trump: (05:57)\n",
      "467But those states-\n",
      "468Chris Wallace: (05:58)\n",
      "469Gentlemen, I want to move onto another subject.\n",
      "470President Donald J. Trump: (06:00)\n",
      "471Those states are not doing well that are shut down right now.\n",
      "472Vice President Joe Biden: (06:02)\n",
      "473I got to respond to that.\n",
      "474President Donald J. Trump: (06:04)\n",
      "475He wants to shut down the whole country.\n",
      "476Chris Wallace: (06:04)\n",
      "477President Trump, you have begun to increasingly question the effectiveness of masks as a disease preventer. And in fact, recently you have cited the issue of waiters touching their masks and touching plates. Are you questioning the efficacy of masks?\n",
      "478President Donald J. Trump: (06:20)\n",
      "479No, I think masks are okay. You have to understand, if you look… I mean, I have a mask right here. I put a mask on when I think I need it. Tonight, as an example, everybody’s had a test and you’ve had social distancing and all of the things that you have to, but I wear masks-\n",
      "480Vice President Joe Biden: (06:33)\n",
      "481Just like your rally.\n",
      "482President Donald J. Trump: (06:33)\n",
      "483… when needed. When needed, I wear masks.\n",
      "484Chris Wallace: (06:35)\n",
      "485Okay. Let me ask-\n",
      "486President Donald J. Trump: (06:36)\n",
      "487I don’t wear a mask like him. Every time you see him, he’s got a mask. He could be speaking 200 feet away from him and he shows up with the biggest mask I’ve ever seen. I will say this-\n",
      "488Chris Wallace: (06:45)\n",
      "489Vice President Biden, go ahead, sir.\n",
      "490Vice President Joe Biden: (06:48)\n",
      "491Look, the way to open businesses is give them the wherewithal to be able open. We provided money, the-\n",
      "492Chris Wallace: (06:55)\n",
      "493But I was asking you, sir, about masks.\n",
      "494Vice President Joe Biden: (06:56)\n",
      "495Well, masks make a big difference. His own head of the CDC said if we just wore masks between now, if everybody wore a mask and social distanced between now and January, we’d probably save up to 100,000 lives. It matters. It matters.\n",
      "496President Donald J. Trump: (07:10)\n",
      "497And they’ve also said the opposite. They’ve also said-\n",
      "498Vice President Joe Biden: (07:12)\n",
      "499No serious person has said the opposite. No serious person.\n",
      "500Chris Wallace: (07:14)\n",
      "501Okay. I want to ask you-\n",
      "502President Donald J. Trump: (07:17)\n",
      "503Dr. Fauci. Dr. Fauci said the opposite.\n",
      "504Vice President Joe Biden: (07:18)\n",
      "505He did not say the opposite.\n",
      "506Chris Wallace: (07:19)\n",
      "507I want to ask you, we’ve got a little than a minute left in this segment.\n",
      "508President Donald J. Trump: (07:22)\n",
      "509He said very strongly, “Masks are not good.” Then he changed his mind. He said, “Masks are good.”\n",
      "510Chris Wallace: (07:25)\n",
      "511I want to ask-\n",
      "512President Donald J. Trump: (07:25)\n",
      "513I’m okay with masks. I’m not fighting masks.\n",
      "514Chris Wallace: (07:27)\n",
      "515I want to ask you both about one last subject because your different approaches has even affected the way that you have campaigned. President Trump, you’re holding large rallies with crowds packed together, thousands of people.\n",
      "516President Donald J. Trump: (07:38)\n",
      "517Outside.\n",
      "518Chris Wallace: (07:39)\n",
      "519Outside. Yes, sir. Agreed. Vice President Biden, you are holding much smaller events with-\n",
      "520President Donald J. Trump: (07:46)\n",
      "521Because nobody will show up.\n",
      "522Chris Wallace: (07:47)\n",
      "523… people with masks.\n",
      "524President Donald J. Trump: (07:47)\n",
      "525Well, it’s true. Nobody shows up to his rallies.\n",
      "526Chris Wallace: (07:50)\n",
      "527All right. In any case, why you holding the big rallies? Why you not? You go first, sir.\n",
      "528President Donald J. Trump: (07:56)\n",
      "529Because people want to hear what I have to say. I mean-\n",
      "530Chris Wallace: (07:59)\n",
      "531But are not worried about us spreading disease?\n",
      "532President Donald J. Trump: (08:01)\n",
      "533… I’m doing my job as a president, and I’ll have 25, 35,000 people show up at airports. We use airports and hangers and we have a lot of people-\n",
      "534Chris Wallace: (08:06)\n",
      "535Are you not worried about the disease issues, sir?\n",
      "536President Donald J. Trump: (08:08)\n",
      "537Well, so far we have had no problem whatsoever. It’s outside. That’s a big difference according to the experts. We do them outside, we have tremendous crowds, as you see, and literally on 24 hours notice. And Joe does the circles and has three people someplace.\n",
      "538Vice President Joe Biden: (08:26)\n",
      "539By the way, did you see one of the last big rallies he had? A reporter came up to him to ask him a question, he said, “No, no, no. Stand back, put on your mask, put on a mask. Have you been tested? I’m way far away from those other people.” That’s what he said, “I’m going to be okay.” He’s not worried about you. He’s not worried about the people out there .\n",
      "540President Donald J. Trump: (08:48)\n",
      "541We’ve had no negative effect.\n",
      "542Vice President Joe Biden: (08:49)\n",
      "543No negative effect. Come on.\n",
      "544President Donald J. Trump: (08:51)\n",
      "545We’ve had no negative effect, and we’ve had 35, 40,000 people at these rallies.\n",
      "546Chris Wallace: (08:55)\n",
      "547All right. Do you want to just quickly finish up? Because I want to move on to our next-\n",
      "548Vice President Joe Biden: (08:57)\n",
      "549Yes, I would. He’s been totally irresponsible the way in which he has handled the social distancing and people wearing masks, basically encouraged them not to. He’s a fool on this.\n",
      "550President Donald J. Trump: (09:08)\n",
      "551If you could get the crowds, you would have done the same thing. But you can’t. Nobody cares.\n",
      "552Chris Wallace: (09:12)\n",
      "553Gentlemen, can we move on to the-\n",
      "554President Donald J. Trump: (09:13)\n",
      "555No cares.\n",
      "556Chris Wallace: (09:13)\n",
      "557Gentlemen, can we move on to the economy?\n",
      "558President Donald J. Trump: (09:15)\n",
      "559Yes.\n",
      "560Chris Wallace: (09:15)\n",
      "561The economy is, I think it’s fair to say, recovering faster than expected from the shutdown-\n",
      "562President Donald J. Trump: (09:22)\n",
      "563Much faster.\n",
      "564Chris Wallace: (09:22)\n",
      "565… in the second quarter. The unemployment rate fell to 8.4% last month. The Federal Reserve says the hit to growth, which is going to be there, is not going to be nearly as big as they had expected. President Trump, you say we are in a V-shaped recovery. Vice President Biden, you say it’s more of a K-shape. What difference does that mean to the American people in terms of the economy? President Trump, in this segment you go first.\n",
      "566President Donald J. Trump: (09:52)\n",
      "567So we built the greatest economy in history. We closed it down because of the China plague. When the plague came in, we closed it down, which was very hard psychologically to do. He didn’t think we should close it down and he was wrong. Again, two million people would be dead now instead of… Still, 204,000 people is too much. One person is too much. Should have never happened from China. But what happened is we closed it down and now we’re reopening and we’re doing record business. We had 10.4 million people in a four month period that we’ve put back into the workforce. That’s a record the likes of which nobody’s ever seen before. And he wants to close down the… He will shut it down again. He will destroy this country.\n",
      "568President Donald J. Trump: (10:31)\n",
      "569A lot of people, between drugs and alcohol and depression, when you start shutting it down, you take a look at what’s happening at some of your Democrat-run states where they have these tough shutdowns. And I’m telling you it’s because they don’t want to open it. One of them came out last week, you saw that, “Oh, we’re going to open up on November 9th.” Why November 9th? Because it’s after the election. They think they’re hurting us by keeping them closed. They’re hurting people. People know what to do. They can social distance. They can wash their hands, they can wear masks. They can do whatever they want, but they got to open these states up.\n",
      "570President Donald J. Trump: (11:04)\n",
      "571When you look at North Carolina, when you look, and these governors are under siege, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and a couple of others, you got to open these states up. It’s not fair. You’re talking about almost it’s like being in prison. And you look at what’s going on with divorce, look at what’s going on with alcoholism and drugs. It’s a very, very sad thing. And he’ll close down the whole country. This guy will close down the whole country and destroy our country. Our country is coming back incredibly well, setting records as it does it. We don’t need somebody to come in and say, “Let’s shut it down.”\n",
      "572Chris Wallace: (11:36)\n",
      "573All right. Your two minutes, sir. We’re now moved to you. As I said, posing the question, the president says it’s a V-shape recovery, you say it’s a K-shaped recovery. What’s the difference?\n",
      "574Vice President Joe Biden: (11:48)\n",
      "575The difference is millionaires and billionaires like him in the middle of the COVID crisis have done very well. Billionaires have made another $300 billion because of his profligate tax proposal, and he only focused on the market. But you folks at home, you folks living in Scranton and Claymont and all the small towns and working class towns in America, how well are you doing? This guy paid a total of $750 in taxes.\n",
      "576President Donald J. Trump: (12:17)\n",
      "577That’s wrong.\n",
      "578Chris Wallace: (12:18)\n",
      "579Sir, wait. No. Sir-\n",
      "580President Donald J. Trump: (12:18)\n",
      "581.\n",
      "582Chris Wallace: (12:20)\n",
      "583Yeah, I understand. You’ve agreed to the two minutes, so please let him have it.\n",
      "584Vice President Joe Biden: (12:23)\n",
      "585Do I get my time back? The fact is that he has in fact, worked on this in a way that he’s going to be the first president of the United States to leave office, having fewer jobs in his administration than when he became president. Fewer jobs than when he became president. First one in American history.\n",
      "586Vice President Joe Biden: (12:40)\n",
      "587Secondly, the people who have lost their jobs are those people who have been on the front lines. Those people who have been saving our lives, those people who have been out there dying. People who’ve been putting themselves in the way to make sure that we could all try to make it. And the idea that he is insisting that we go forward and open when you have almost half the states in America with a significant increase in COVID deaths and COVID cases in the United States of America, and he wants to open it up more. Why is he want to open it up? Why does he take care of the… You can’t fix the economy until you fix the COVID crisis. And he has no intention of doing anything about making it better for you all at home in terms of your health and your safety.\n",
      "588Vice President Joe Biden: (13:25)\n",
      "589Schools. Why aren’t schools open? Because it costs a lot of money to open them safely. They were going to give, his administration going to give the teachers and school students masks, and then they decided no, couldn’t do that because it’s not a national emergency. Not a national emergency. They’ve done nothing to help small businesses. Nothing. They’re closing. One in six is now gone. He ought to get on the job and take care of the needs of the American people so we can open safely.\n",
      "590Chris Wallace: (13:54)\n",
      "591All right. Your time is up, sir. We are going to get to-\n",
      "592President Donald J. Trump: (13:56)\n",
      "593I have to respond to that.\n",
      "594Chris Wallace: (13:57)\n",
      "595Well, you both had two minutes, sir.\n",
      "596President Donald J. Trump: (13:59)\n",
      "597Excuse me, he made a statement.\n",
      "598Chris Wallace: (14:01)\n",
      "599And so did you.\n",
      "600President Donald J. Trump: (14:03)\n",
      "601No, people want their schools open. They don’t want to be shut down. They don’t want their state shut down. They want their restaurants. I look at New York. It’s so sad what’s happening in New York. It’s almost like a ghost town, and I’m not sure it can ever recover what they’ve done to New York. People want their places open. They want to get back to their lives.\n",
      "602Vice President Joe Biden: (14:19)\n",
      "603People want to be safe.\n",
      "604President Donald J. Trump: (14:20)\n",
      "605They’ll be careful, but they want their schools open.\n",

      "615Gentlemen, we’re going to get to your economic plans going forward in a moment, but first, Mr. President, as you well know, there’s a new report that in 2016, the year you were elected president, and 2017, your first year as president, that you paid $750 a year in federal income tax each of those years. I know that you pay a lot of other taxes, but I’m asking you this specific question. Is it true that you paid $750 in federal income taxes each of those two years?\n",
      "616President Donald J. Trump: (15:08)\n",
      "617I paid millions of dollars in taxes, millions of dollars of income tax. And let me just tell you, there was a story in one of the papers that paid-\n",

There’s 118 page or so report that says everything I have, every bank I have, I’m totally under leveraged because the assets are extremely good, and I built a great company.\n",

      "629But let me tell you-\n",
      "630Chris Wallace: (15:43)\n",
      "631I understand all of that.\n",

      "657Chris, let me just say something, that it was the tax laws. I don’t want to pay tax. Before I came here, I was a private developer, I was a private business people. Like every other private person, unless they’re stupid, they go through the laws, and that’s what it is. He passed a tax bill that gave us all these privileges for depreciation and for tax credits. We build the building and we get tax credits, like the hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. Which by the way, was given to me by the Obama administration, if you can believe that. Now the man got fired right after that happened, but that’s-\n",

      "659Vice President Biden, you want to respond?\n",
      "660Vice President Joe Biden: (16:42)\n",
      "661Yeah, I do want to respond. Look, the tax code that put him in a position that he pays less tax than on the money a school teacher makes is because of him… He says he’s smart because he can take advantage of the tax code. And he does take advantage of the tax code. That’s why I’m going to eliminate the Trump tax cuts. And I’m going to eliminate those tax cuts.\n",
      "662President Donald J. Trump: (17:06)\n",

      "678President Donald J. Trump: (17:24)\n",
      "679Hey, Joe, let me just tell you, Joe. In 47 months, I’ve done more than you’ve done in 47 years, Joe. We’ve done things that you never even thought of doing.\n",
      "680Chris Wallace: (17:33)\n",
      "681Okay. Gentlemen?\n",
      "682President Donald J. Trump: (17:33)\n",

      "684Chris Wallace: (17:38)\n",
      "685Mr. President, we’re talking about the economy. I’d like to ask you about your plans going forward because Mr. Vice President, your economic plan-\n",
      "686President Donald J. Trump: (17:46)\n",
      "687He has none.\n",
      "688Chris Wallace: (17:47)\n",
      "689… if you were to be elected president focuses a lot on big government, big taxes, big spending. I want to focus first on the taxes. You propose more than $4 trillion over a decade in new taxes on individuals making more than $400,000 a year.\n",
      "690Chris Wallace: (18:03)\n",
      "691… on individuals making more than $400,000 a year and on corporations. President Trump says that that kind of an increase in taxes is going to hurt the economy as it’s just coming out of a recession.\n",
      "692Vice President Joe Biden: (18:13)\n",
      "693Well, just take a look at what is the analysis done by Wall Street firms, points out that my economic plan would create 7 million more jobs than his in four years, number one. And number two, it would create an additional $1 trillion in economic growth, because it would be about buying American. The federal government spends $600 billion a year on everything from ships, to steel, to buildings and the like. And under my proposal, we’re going to make sure that every penny of that has to be made by a company-\n",
      "694Chris Wallace: (18:50)\n",

      "696Vice President Joe Biden: (18:53)\n",
      "697By the way, I’m going to eliminate a significant number of the taxes. I’m going to make the corporate tax 28%. It shouldn’t be 21%. You have 91 companies federal, I mean, the fortune 500, who don’t pay a single penny in tax making billions of dollars.\n",

      "715Mr. President, let me pick up on that. You would continue your free market approach, lower taxes, more deregulation, correct?\n",
      "716Vice President Joe Biden: (19:31)\n",
      "717Not lower tax for the American people.\n",

      "721Excuse me.\n",
      "722Chris Wallace: (19:34)\n",
      "723You talk about the economy booming. It turns out that in Obama’s final three years as president more jobs were created, a million and a half more jobs, than in the first three years of your presidency.\n",
      "724President Donald J. Trump: (19:47)\n",
      "725They had the slowest economic recovery since 1929. It was the slowest recovery. Also, they took over something that was down here. All you had to do is turn on the lights and you pick up a lot. But they had the slowest economic recovery since 1929, and let me tell you about the stock market. When the stock market goes up, that means jobs. It also means 401ks. If you got in, if you ever became president with your ideas, you want to terminate my taxes. I’ll tell you what, you’ll lose. Half of the companies that have poured in here will leave. And plenty of companies that are already here, they’ll leave for other places.  They will leave and you will have a depression, the likes of which you’ve never seen.\n",

      "731… we inherited the worst recession, short of a depression in American history. I was asked to bring it back. We were able to have an economic recovery that created the jobs you’re talking about. We handed him a booming economy, he blew it.\n",
      "732President Donald J. Trump: (20:44)\n",
      "733It wasn’t blooming.\n",
      "734Vice President Joe Biden: (20:45)\n",

      "741When COVID came along.\n",
      "742Chris Wallace: (20:54)\n",
      "743… when there was record low unemployment before COVID.\n",
      "744Vice President Joe Biden: (20:57)\n",
      "745Yeah, because what he did, even before COVID, manufacturing went in the hole. Manufacturing went in a hole-\n",

      "973President Trump, you have often said that you believe you will have done more for Black Americans than any president with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln.\n",
      "974President Donald J. Trump: (26:16)\n",
      "975That’s true.\n",
      "976Chris Wallace: (26:16)\n",
      "977My question for the two of you, is why should voters trust you rather than your opponent to deal with the race issues facing this country over the next four years? Vice President Biden, you go first.\n",
      "978Vice President Joe Biden: (26:29)\n",
      "979It’s about equity and equality. It’s about decency. It’s about the constitution. And we have never walked away from trying to require equity for everyone, equality for the whole of America. But we’ve never accomplished it, but we’ve never walked away from it like he has done. It is true, the reason I got in the race is when those people… Close your eyes, remember what those people look like coming out of the fields, carrying torches, their veins bulging, just spewing anti-Semitic bile and accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan. A young woman got killed and they asked the president what he thought. He said, “There were very fine people on both sides.” No president’s ever said anything like that. .\n",
      "980Chris Wallace: (27:11)\n",
      "981It is his-\n",
      "982Vice President Joe Biden: (27:12)\n",
      "983Now-\n",
      "984Chris Wallace: (27:12)\n",
      "985… minute sir.\n",
      "986Vice President Joe Biden: (27:13)\n",
      "987… second point I’d make to you, is that when Floyd was killed, when Mr. Floyd was killed, there was a peaceful protest in front of the White House. What did he do? He came out of his bunker, had the military use tear gas on them so he could walk across to a church and hold up a Bible. And then what happened after that? The Bishop of that very church said that it was a disgrace. The general who was with him said all he ever wants to do is divide people, not unite people at all. This is a president who has used everything as a dog whistle, to try to generate racists hatred, racist division.\n",
      "988Vice President Joe Biden: (27:50)\n",
      "989This is a man who, in fact, you talk about helping African-Americans, one in 1000 African Americans has been killed because of the coronavirus. And if he doesn’t do something quickly, by the end of the year, one in 500 will have been killed. One in 500 African Americans. This man is as a savior of African-Americans? This man cares at all? This man’s done virtually nothing. Look, the fact is that you have to look at what he talks about. You have to look at what he did. And what he did has been disastrous for the African-American community.\n",
      "990President Donald J. Trump: (28:27)\n",
      "991So-\n",
      "992Chris Wallace: (28:28)\n",
      "993President Trump, you have two minutes. Why should Americans trust you over your opponent to deal race issues?\n",
      "994President Donald J. Trump: (28:34)\n",
      "995You did a crime bill, 1994, where you call them super predators. African-Americans are super predators and they’ve never forgotten it. They’ve never forgotten it.\n",
      "996Vice President Joe Biden: (28:43)\n",
      "997I’ve never said-\n",
      "998Chris Wallace: (28:44)\n",
      "999No, no, sir. It’s his two minutes.\n",
      "1000President Donald J. Trump: (28:45)\n",
      "1001So you did that and they call you a super predator and I’m letting people out of jail now, that you have treated the African-American population community, you have treated the black community about as bad as anybody in this country. You did the 1990… And that’s why, if you look at the polls, I’m doing better than any Republican has done in a long time, because they saw what you did. You call them super predators, and you’ve called them worse than that. Because you look back at your testimony over the years, you’ve called them a lot worse than that. As far as the church is concerned and as far as the generals are concerned, we just got the support of 250 military leaders and generals, total support. Law enforcement, almost every law enforcement group in the United States. I have Florida. I have Texas. I have Ohio. I have every… Excuse me, Portland, the sheriff just came out today and he said, “I support President Trump.”\n",
      "1002President Donald J. Trump: (29:39)\n",
      "1003I don’t think you have any law enforcement. You can’t even say the word law enforcement. Because if you say those words, you’re going to lose all of your radical left supporters. And why aren’t you saying those words, Joe? Why don’t you say the words law enforcement? Because you know what? If called us in Portland, we would put out that fire in a half an hour. But they won’t do it, because they’re run by radical left Democrats. If you look at Chicago, if you look at any place you want to look, Seattle, they heard we were coming in the following day and they put up their hands and we got back Seattle. Minneapolis, we got it back, Joe, because we believe in law and order, but you don’t. The top 10 cities and just about the top 40 cities are run by Democrats, and in many cases radical left. And they’ve got you wrapped around their finger, Joe, to a point where you don’t want to say anything about law and order. And I’ll tell you what, the people of this country want and demand law and order and you’re afraid to even say it.\n",
      "1004Chris Wallace: (30:35)\n",
      "1005All right. I want to return to the question of race. Vice President Biden, after the grand jury in the Breonna Taylor case decided not to charge any of the police with homicide, you said it raises the question, “Whether justice could be equally applied in America.” Do you believe that there is a separate but unequal system of justice for Blacks in this country?\n",
      "1006Vice President Joe Biden: (30:59)\n",
      "1007Yes, there is. There’s systemic injustice in this country, in education and work and in law enforcement and the way in which it’s enforced. But look, the vast majority of police officers are good, decent, honorable men and women. They risk their lives every day to take care of us, but there are some bad apples. And when they occur, when they find them, they have to be sorted out. They have to be held accountable. They have to be held accountable. And what I’m going to do as President of the United States is call together an entire group of people at the White House, everything from the civil rights groups, to the police officers, to the police chiefs, and we’re going to work this out.\n",
      "1008Vice President Joe Biden: (31:38)\n",
      "1009We’re going to work this out. So we changed the way in which we have more transparency, in when these things happen. These cops aren’t happy to see what happened to George Floyd. These cops aren’t happy to see what happened to Breonna Taylor. Most don’t like it, but we have to have a system where people are held accountable when… And by the way, violence in response is never appropriate, never appropriate. Peaceful protest is, violence is never appropriate.\n",
      "1010Chris Wallace: (32:04)\n",
      "1011All right, Mr.-\n",
      "1012President Donald J. Trump: (32:05)\n",

      "1016President Donald J. Trump: (32:09)\n",

      "1018Vice President Joe Biden: (32:11)\n",
      "1019That is not peaceful protest.\n",
      "1020President Donald J. Trump: (32:13)\n",
      "1021No it’s not, but you say it is.\n",
      "1022Chris Wallace: (32:15)\n",
      "1023President Trump, I’d like to continue with the issue of race. I promise we’re going to get to the issue of law and order in a moment.\n",
      "1024President Donald J. Trump: (32:21)\n",
      "1025Fine.\n",
      "1026Chris Wallace: (32:21)\n",
      "1027This month, your administration directed federal agencies to end racial sensitivity training that addresses white privilege or critical race theory. Why did you decide to do that, to end racial sensitivity training? And do you believe that there is systemic racism in this country, sir?\n",
      "1028President Donald J. Trump: (32:42)\n",
      "1029I ended it because it’s racist. I ended it because a lot of people were complaining that they were asked to do things that were absolutely insane. That it a radical revolution that was taking place in our military, in our schools, all over the place. And you know it, and so does everybody else. And he would know it- \n",
      "1030Chris Wallace: (33:02)\n",
      "1031What is radical about racial sensitivity training?\n",
      "1032President Donald J. Trump: (33:05)\n",
      "1033If you were a certain person, you had no status in life. It was sort of a reversal. And if you look at the people, we were paying people hundreds of thousands of dollars to teach very bad ideas and frankly, very sick ideas. And really, they were teaching people to hate our country And I’m not going to do that. I’m not going to allow that to happen. We have to go back to the core values of this country. They were teaching people that our country is a horrible place. It’s a racist place. And they were teaching people to hate our country. And I’m not going to allow that to happen.\n",

      "1043Let him finish.\n",
      "1044Vice President Joe Biden: (33:47)\n",
      "1045The fact is that there is racial insensitivity. People have to be made aware of what other people feel like, what insults them, what is demeaning to them. It’s important people know. Many people don’t want to hurt other people’s feelings, but it makes a big difference. It makes a gigantic difference in the way a child is able to grow up and have a sense of self-esteem. It’s a little bit like how this guy and his friends look down on so many people. They look down their nose on people like Irish Catholics, like me, who grow up in Scranton. They look down on people who don’t have money. They look down on people who are of a different faith. They looked down on people who are a different color. In fact, we’re all Americans. The only way we’re going to bring this country together is bring everybody together. There’s nothing we cannot do, if we do it together. We can take this on and we can defeat racism in American.\n",

      "1085That’s exactly my question. There has been a dramatic increase in homicides in America this summer particularly, and you often blame that on democratic mayors and democratic governors. But in fact, there have been equivalent spikes in Republican led cities, like Tulsa and Fort Worth. So the question is, is this really a…\n",
      "1086Chris Wallace: (36:03)\n",
      "1087It’s like Tulsa and Fort worth. So the question is, is this really a party issue?\n",
      "1088President Donald J. Trump: (36:05)\n",
      "1089I think as a party issue, you can bring in a couple of examples but if you look at Chicago, what’s going on in Chicago where a 53 people were shot and eight died shot, if you look at New York where it’s going up, like nobody’s ever seen anything. The numbers are going up a 100%, 150%, 200% crime, it is crazy what’s going on and he doesn’t want to say law and order because he can’t because he’ll lose his radical left supporters and once he does that, it’s over with. But if he ever got to run this country and they ran it the way he would want to run it, we would have by the way our suburbs would be gone. And you would see problems like you’ve never seen before.\n",

      "1097I was raised in the suburbs. This is not 1950. All these dog whistles and racism don’t work anymore. Suburbs are by and large integrated. There’s many people today driving their kids to soccer practice and/or black and white and Hispanic in the same car as there have been any time in the past, what really is a threat to the suburbs and their safety is his failure to deal with COVID. They’re dying in the suburbs. His failure to deal with the environment, they’re being flooded, they’re being burned out because his refusal to do anything. That’s why the suburbs are in trouble.\n",
      "1098Chris Wallace: (37:23)\n",
      "1099I do want to talk about this issue of law and order though. And in the joint recommendation that came from the Biden-Bernie Sanders task force, you talked about quote re-imagining policing. First of all, what does re-imagining policing mean and do you support? If I might finish the question, what does re-imagining policing mean and do you support the Black Lives Matter call for community control of policing?\n",
      "1100Vice President Joe Biden: (37:54)\n",
      "1101Look, what I support are the police having the opportunity to deal with the problems they face and I’m totally opposed to defunding the police offices. As a matter of fact police, local police, the only one defunding in his budget calls for a $400 million cut in local law enforcement assistance. They need more assistance. They need when they show up for a 9-11 call to have someone with them as a psychologist or psychiatrist to keep them from having to use force and be able to talk people down. We have to have community policing like we had before where the officers get to know the people in the communities. That’s when crime went down, it didn’t go up. It went down. And so we have to be…\n",

Many of those turned into riots. Mr. Vice-president you say that people who commit crimes should be held accountable. The question I have though is as the democratic nominee, and earlier tonight, you said that you are the Democratic Party right now, have you ever called the Democratic Mayor of Portland or the Democratic Governor of Oregon and said, “Hey, you got to stop this, bring in the National Guard, do whatever it takes, but you’d stop the days and months of violence in Portland.”\n",

      "1215I’m going to ask a question. When the president seeks a second term, it is generally a referendum on his record but vice president Biden, you’d like to quote one of your dad’s sayings, which is don’t compare me to the almighty, compare me to the alternative. And in this case sir you are the alternative. Looking at both of your records, I’m going to ask each of you. Why should voters elect you president over your opponent in this segment, President Trump you’ll go first, two minutes.\n",
      "1216President Donald J. Trump: (43:30)\n",
      "1217Because there is never been an administration or president who has done more than I’ve done in a period of three and a half years. And that’s despite the impeachment hoax and you so what happened today with Hillary Clinton, where it was a whole big con job. But despite going through all of these things where I had a fight, both flanks and behind me and above there has never been an administration that’s done what I’ve done. The greatest, before COVID came in the greatest economy in history, lowest unemployment numbers, everything was good. Everything was going.\n",
      "1218President Donald J. Trump: (44:03)\n",
      "1219And by the way, there was unity going to happen. People were calling me for the first time in years, they were calling and they were saying it’s time maybe and then what happened? We got hit. But now we’re building it back up again. A rebuilding of the military, including Space Force and all of the other things. A fixing of the VA which was a mess under him, 308,000 people died because they didn’t have proper health care. It was a mess. And we now got a 91% approval rating at the VA, our vets. We take care of our vets. But we’ve rebuilt our military. And I’ll tell you something, some people say maybe the most important by the end of the first term I’ll have approximately 300 Federal judges and Court of Appeals judges, 300 and hopefully three great Supreme Court judges, justices that is a record the likes of which very few people and one of the reasons I’ll have so many judges because President Obama and him left me 128 judges to fill.\n",
      "1220President Donald J. Trump: (45:05)\n",
      "1221When you leave office, you don’t leave any judges. That’s like, you just don’t do that. They left 128 openings and if I were a member of his party, because they have a little different philosophy, I’d say, if you left us 128 openings you can’t be a good president. You can’t be a good vice president but I want to thank you because it gives us almost, it’ll probably be above that number. By the end of this term, 300 judges. It’s a record.\n",
      "1222Chris Wallace: (45:34)\n",
      "1223Looking at both of your records. Why should voters elect you President as opposed to president Trump, you have two minutes uninterrupted.\n",
      "1224Vice President Joe Biden: (45:42)\n",
      "1225Under this president, we become weaker, sicker, poor, more divided and more violent. When I was vice president, we inherited a recession. I was asked to fix it. I did. We left him a booming economy and he caused the recession. With regard to being weaker, the fact is that I’ve gone head to head with Putin and made it clear to him we’re not going to take any of his stuff. He’s Putin’s puppy. He still refuses to even say anything to Putin about the bounty on the heads of American soldiers.\n",

You in the home, you got less you’re in more trouble than you were before. In terms of being more violent. When we were in office there were 15% less violence in America than there is today. He’s President United States. It’s on his watch. And with regard to more divided the nation, it can’t stay divided. We can’t be this way. And speaking of my son, the way you talk about the military, the way you talk about them being losers and being and just being suckers. My son was in Iraq. He spent a year there. He got the Brown Star. He got the Conspicuous Service Medal. He was not a loser. He was a Patriot and the people left behind there were heroes.\n",

When state officials there blamed the fires on climate change. Mr. President, you said, I don’t think the science knows. Over your four years, you have pulled the US out of the Paris Climate Accord. You have rolled back a number of Obama Environmental records, what do you believe about the science of climate change and what will you do in the next four years to confront it?\n",

But I haven’t destroyed our businesses. Our businesses aren’t put out of commission. If you look at the Paris Accord, it was a disaster from our standpoint. And people are actually very happy about what’s going on because our businesses are doing well. As far as the fires are concerned, you need forest management. In addition to everything else, the forest floors are loaded up with trees, dead trees that are years old and they’re like tinder and leaves and everything else. You drop a cigarette in there the whole forest burns down. You’ve got to have forest management.\n",

      "How are you doing? Thank you very much, Chris. I will tell you very simply. We won the election. Elections have consequences. We have the Senate, we have the White House, and we have a phenomenal nominee respected by all. Top, top academic, good in every way. Good in every way. In fact, some of her biggest endorsers are very liberal people from Notre Dame and other places. So I think she’s going to be fantastic. We have plenty of time. Even if we did it after the election itself. I have a lot of time after the election, as you know. So I think that she will be outstanding. She’s going to be as good as anybody that has served on that court. We really feel that. We have a professor at Notre Dame, highly respected by all, said she’s the single greatest student he’s ever had. He’s been a professor for a long time at a great school. And we won the election and therefore we have the right to choose her, and very few people knowingly would say otherwise. And by the way, the Democrats, they wouldn’t even think about not doing it. The only difference is they’d try and do it faster. There’s no way they would give it up. They had Merrick Garland, but the problem is they didn’t have the election so they were stopped. And probably that would happen in reverse, also. Definitely would happen in reverse. So we won the election and we have the right to do it, Chris. Thank you, Joe. There aren’t a hundred million people with pre-existing conditions. As far as a say is concerned, the people already had their say. Okay, Justice Ginsburg said very powerfully, very strongly, at some point 10 years ago or so, she said a President and the Senate is elected for a period of time, but a President is elected for four years. We’re not elected for three years. I’m not elected for three years. So we have the Senate, we have a President- During that period of time, during that period of time, we have an opening. I’m not elected for three years. I’m elected for four years. Joe, the hundred million people is totally wrong. I don’t know where you got that number. The bigger problem that you have is that you’re going to extinguish 180 million people with their private health care, that they’re very happy this. Well, you’re certainly going to socialist. You’re going to socialist medicine- That’s not what you’ve said and it’s not what your party is saying. Your party doesn’t say it. Your party wants to go socialist medicine and socialist healthcare. And they’re going to dominate you, Joe. You know that. Not according to Harris. Joe, you’ve had 308,000 military people dying because you couldn’t provide them proper healthcare in the military. So don’t tell me about this. And if you were here, it wouldn’t be 200, it would be two million people because you were very late on the draw. You didn’t want me to ban China, which was heavily infected. You didn’t want me to ban Europe. You would have been much later, Joe, much later. We’re talking about two million people. You don’t know what’s on the ballot. Why is it on the ballot? Why is it on the ballot? It’s not on the ballot. I don’t think so. There’s nothing happening there. You don’t know her view on Roe V. Wade? You don’t know here view. That’s right. Because they want to give good healthcare. Yes, I have. Of course, I have. The individual mandate. Excuse me. I got rid of the individual mandate, which was a big chunk of Obamacare. That is absolutely a big thing. That was the worst part of Obamacare. Chris, that was the worst part of Obamacare. Well, I’ll ask Joe. The individual mandate was the most unpopular aspect of Obamacare. I got rid of it. And we will protect people. Go ahead. Well, first of all, I guess I’m debating you, not him, but that’s okay. I’m not surprised. Let me just tell you something. There’s nothing symbolic. I’m cutting drug prices. I’m going with Favored Nations, which no President has the courage to do because you’re going against big pharma. Drug prices will be coming down 80 or 90%. You could have done it during your 47 year period in government, but you didn’t do it. Nobody’s done it. So we’re cutting healthcare. All of the things that we’ve done. I’ll give you an example. Insulin, it was destroying families, destroying people, the cost. I’m getting it for so cheap it’s like water, you want to know the truth. So cheap. Take a look at all of the drugs that what we’re doing. Prescription drug prices, we’re going to allow our Governors now to go to other countries to buy drugs because when they paid just a tiny fraction of what we do. This is big stuff. That’s not what your party says, by the way. Joe, you agreed with Bernie Sanders, who’s far left, on the manifesto, we call it. And that gives you socialized medicine. Are you saying you didn’t agree? Not by much. Not by much. If Pocahontas would have left two days early you would have lost every primary. On Super Tuesday, you got very lucky. With what? With what? But you agree. Joe, you’re the liar. You graduated last in your class not first in your class. You’d be surprised. You’d be surprised. Go ahead, Joe. Listen, you agreed with Bernie Sanders and the manifesto. He just lost the left. You just lost the left. You agreed with Bernie Sanders on a plan that you absolutely agreed to and under that plan , they call it socialized medicine. Who is, Bernie? No, I want to give them better healthcare at a much lower price, because Obamacare is no good. I’ve already fixed it. We’ve already fixed it to an extent. Obamacare, as you might know but probably don’t, Obamacare is no good. Obamacare is no good. We made it better and I had a choice to make very early on. We took away the individual mandate. We guaranteed pre-existing conditions, but took away the individual mandate. Listen, this is the way it is. And that destroyed … They shouldn’t even call it Obamacare, then I had a choice to make, do I let my people run it really well or badly? If I run it badly, they’ll probably blame him, but they’ll blame me. But more importantly, I want to help people. Okay. I said, “You’ve got to run it so well.” And I just had a meeting with them. They said the problem is, no matter how well you run Obamacare, it’s a disaster. It’s too expensive. Premiums are too high, that it doesn’t work. So we do want to get rid of it. Chris, we want to get rid of that and give something that’s cheaper and better. Go ahead. Good. Of course, we do. Are you going to pack the court? Are you going to pack the court? He doesn’t want to answer the question. Why wouldn’t you answer that question? You want to put a lot of new Supreme Court Justices. Radical left. Listen, who is on your list, Joe? Who’s on your list? He’s going to pack the court. He is not going to give a list. The people understand, Joe. 47 years, you’ve done nothing. They’re understand. Wrong. Wrong. It’s so wrong. So, if we would have listened to you. If we would’ve listened to you, the country would have been left wide open, millions of people would have died, not 200,000. And one person is too much. It’s China’s fault. It should have never happened. They stopped it from going in, but it was China’s fault. And, by the way, when you talk about numbers, you don’t know how many people died in China. You don’t know how many people died in Russia. You don’t know how many people died in India. They don’t exactly give you a straight count, just so you understand. But if you look at what we’ve done, I closed it and you said, “He’s xenophobic. He’s a racist and he’s xenophobic,” because you didn’t think I should have closed our country. Wait a minute. You didn’t think we should have closed our country because you thought it was terrible. You wouldn’t have closed it for another two months. By my doing it early, in fact, Dr. Fauci said, “President Trump saved thousands of lives.” Many of your Democrat Governors said, “President Trump did a phenomenal job.” We worked with the Governor. Oh really, go take a look. The Governors said I did a phenomenal job. Most of them said that. In fact, people that would not be necessarily on my side said that, “President Trump did a phenomenal job.” We did. We got the gowns. We got the masks. We made the ventilators. You wouldn’t have made ventilators. And now we’re weeks away from a vaccine. We’re doing therapeutics already. Fewer people are dying when they get sick. Far fewer people are dying. We’ve done a great job. The only thing I haven’t done a good job, and that’s because of the fake news, no matter what you say to them, they give you a bad press on it. It’s just fake news. They give you good press, they give me bad press because that’s the way it is, unfortunately. But let me just say something. I don’t care. I’ve gotten used to it. But I’ll tell you, Joe, you could never have done the job that we did. You don’t have it in your blood. You could’ve never done that, Joe. Well, you didn’t do very well in Swine Flu. H1-N1, you were a disaster. Your own Chief of Staff said you were a disaster. A far less lethal disease, by the way. We would have lost far more people, far more people. You would have been months late. You’re months behind me, Joe. You don’t trust Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer? Well, I’ve spoken to the companies and we can have it a lot sooner. It’s a very political thing because people like this would rather make it political than save lives. It is a very political thing. I’ve spoken to Pfizer, I’ve spoken to all of the people that you have to speak to, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and others. They can go faster than that by a lot. It’s become very political because the left… Or I don’t know if I call them left, I don’t know what I call them. I disagree with him. No, I disagree with both of them. And he didn’t say that. He said it could be there, but it could also be much sooner. I had him in my office two days ago. Because he said it’s a possibility that we’ll have the answer before November 1st. It could also be after that. Well, we’re going to deliver it right away. We have the military all set up. Logistically, they’re all set up. We have our military that delivers soldiers and they can do 200,000 a day. They’re going to be delivering- It’s all set up. That was said sarcastically, and you know that. That was said sarcastically. You’ll have the vaccine sooner than that. We spoke to the scientists that are in charge- … they will have the vaccine very soon. Did you use the word smart? So you said you went to Delaware State, but you forgot the name of your college. You didn’t go to Delaware State. You graduated either the lowest or almost the lowest in your class. Don’t ever use the word smart with me. Don’t ever use that word. Because you know what? There’s nothing smart about you, Joe. 47 years you’ve done nothing. Let me just tell you something, Joe. If you would have had the charge of what I was put through, I had to close the greatest economy of the history of our country. And by the way, now it’s being built again and it’s going up fast. Okay. It’s going up fast. I look forward to talking about it. Tell that to Nancy Pelosi. Tell that to Nancy Pelosi, and Schumer  Chuck. You probably play more than I do, Joe. Well, he wants to shut down this country and I want to keep it open, and we did a great thing by shutting it down- Wait a minute, Joe. Let me shut you down for a second, Joe, just for one second. He wants to shut down the country. We just went through it. We had to, because we didn’t know anything about the disease. Now we’ve found that elderly people with heart problems and diabetes and different problems are very, very vulnerable. We learned a lot. Young children aren’t, even younger people aren’t. We’ve learned a lot, but he wants to shut it down. More people will be hurt by continuing. If you look at Pennsylvania, if you look at certain states that have been shut down, they have Democrat governors, all, one of the reasons they shut down is because they want to keep it shut down until after the election on November 3rd. Because it’s a political thing. But those states- Those states are not doing well that are shut down right now. He wants to shut down the whole country. No, I think masks are okay. You have to understand, if you look… I mean, I have a mask right here. I put a mask on when I think I need it. Tonight, as an example, everybody’s had a test and you’ve had social distancing and all of the things that you have to, but I wear masks- … when needed. When needed, I wear masks. I don’t wear a mask like him. Every time you see him, he’s got a mask. He could be speaking 200 feet away from him and he shows up with the biggest mask I’ve ever seen. I will say this- And they’ve also said the opposite. They’ve also said- Dr. Fauci. Dr. Fauci said the opposite. He said very strongly, “Masks are not good.” Then he changed his mind. He said, “Masks are good.” I’m okay with masks. I’m not fighting masks. Outside. Because nobody will show up. Well, it’s true. Nobody shows up to his rallies. Because people want to hear what I have to say. I mean- … I’m doing my job as a president, and I’ll have 25, 35,000 people show up at airports. We use airports and hangers and we have a lot of people- Well, so far we have had no problem whatsoever. It’s outside. That’s a big difference according to the experts. We do them outside, we have tremendous crowds, as you see, and literally on 24 hours notice. And Joe does the circles and has three people someplace. We’ve had no negative effect. We’ve had no negative effect, and we’ve had 35, 40,000 people at these rallies. If you could get the crowds, you would have done the same thing. But you can’t. Nobody cares. No cares. Yes. Much faster. So we built the greatest economy in history. We closed it down because of the China plague. When the plague came in, we closed it down, which was very hard psychologically to do. He didn’t think we should close it down and he was wrong. Again, two million people would be dead now instead of… Still, 204,000 people is too much. One person is too much. Should have never happened from China. But what happened is we closed it down and now we’re reopening and we’re doing record business. We had 10.4 million people in a four month period that we’ve put back into the workforce. That’s a record the likes of which nobody’s ever seen before. And he wants to close down the… He will shut it down again. He will destroy this country. A lot of people, between drugs and alcohol and depression, when you start shutting it down, you take a look at what’s happening at some of your Democrat-run states where they have these tough shutdowns. And I’m telling you it’s because they don’t want to open it. One of them came out last week, you saw that, “Oh, we’re going to open up on November 9th.” Why November 9th? Because it’s after the election. They think they’re hurting us by keeping them closed. They’re hurting people. People know what to do. They can social distance. They can wash their hands, they can wear masks. They can do whatever they want, but they got to open these states up. When you look at North Carolina, when you look, and these governors are under siege, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and a couple of others, you got to open these states up. It’s not fair. You’re talking about almost it’s like being in prison. And you look at what’s going on with divorce, look at what’s going on with alcoholism and drugs. It’s a very, very sad thing. And he’ll close down the whole country. This guy will close down the whole country and destroy our country. Our country is coming back incredibly well, setting records as it does it. We don’t need somebody to come in and say, “Let’s shut it down.” That’s wrong. . I have to respond to that. Excuse me, he made a statement. No, people want their schools open. They don’t want to be shut down. They don’t want their state shut down. They want their restaurants. I look at New York. It’s so sad what’s happening in New York. It’s almost like a ghost town, and I’m not sure it can ever recover what they’ve done to New York. People want their places open. They want to get back to their lives. They’ll be careful, but they want their schools open. I’m the one that brought back football. By the way, I brought back Big Ten football. It was me and I’m very happy to do it- … and people of Ohio are very proud of me. And you know how I found out? When . I paid millions of dollars in taxes, millions of dollars of income tax. And let me just tell you, there was a story in one of the papers that paid- I paid $38 million one year, I paid $27 million one year. You’ll see it as soon as it’s finished, you’ll see it. You know, if you wanted to, go to the Board of Elections. There’s 118 page or so report that says everything I have, every bank I have, I’m totally under leveraged because the assets are extremely good, and I built a great company. But let me tell you- Let me- Millions of dollars. Millions of dollars, yes. Millions of dollars. And you’ll get to see it. And you’ll get to see it. But let me just tell you- Chris, let me just say something, that it was the tax laws. I don’t want to pay tax. Before I came here, I was a private developer, I was a private business people. Like every other private person, unless they’re stupid, they go through the laws, and that’s what it is. He passed a tax bill that gave us all these privileges for depreciation and for tax credits. We build the building and we get tax credits, like the hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. Which by the way, was given to me by the Obama administration, if you can believe that. Now the man got fired right after that happened, but that’s- That’s okay. But why didn’t you do it over the last 25 years? Why didn’t you do it over the last 25 years? You were a Senator and - Hey, Joe, let me just tell you, Joe. In 47 months, I’ve done more than you’ve done in 47 years, Joe. We’ve done things that you never even thought of doing. Including fixing the broken military that you gave me, including taking care of your debts. He has none. Why didn’t you do it before, when you were vice president with Obama? I got it done. And you know what happened? Our economy boomed like it’s never boomed before. Excuse me. They had the slowest economic recovery since 1929. It was the slowest recovery. Also, they took over something that was down here. All you had to do is turn on the lights and you pick up a lot. But they had the slowest economic recovery since 1929, and let me tell you about the stock market. When the stock market goes up, that means jobs. It also means 401ks. If you got in, if you ever became president with your ideas, you want to terminate my taxes. I’ll tell you what, you’ll lose. Half of the companies that have poured in here will leave. And plenty of companies that are already here, they’ll leave for other places.  They will leave and you will have a depression, the likes of which you’ve never seen. It wasn’t blooming. He was in booming. It was the weakest recovery since 1929. When COVID came along. Excuse me, Chris, wait. Chris. They said it would take… No, you’re on number two. Chris, Chris. They said it would take- … a miracle to bring back manufacturing. I brought back 700,000 jobs. They brought back nothing. They gave up on manufacturing. … standard fare. He totally gave up on manufacturing. Ohio had the best year it’s ever had last year. Michigan had the best year they’ve ever had. Many car companies came in from Germany, from Japan, went to Michigan, went to Ohio and they didn’t come in with you. . China ate your lunch- 07]. China ate your lunch, Joe. And no wonder your son goes in and he takes out billions of dollars. He takes out billions of dollars to manage. He makes millions of dollars. And also, while we’re at it, why is it just out of curiosity, the mayor of Moscow’s wife gave you a son three and a half million dollars? What did he do to deserve it? What did he do with- … to deserve $183,000? Oh really, he didn’t get three and a half million? Well wait, he didn’t get three and a half million dollars, Joe? He got three and a half million- … dollars. Oh, really? It’s a fact. Did Burisma pay him 183,000 a month, with no experience in energy? I think he did. By who? The media. By the media, because they refuse to talk about it- … because they’re embarrassed. So let me ask you this, Joe- . He got three and a half million dollars from Moscow. Oh, really? I’d like to know who they are. I’ll fire them. Some people don’t do a good job. Hey, let me just tell you, Joe- Three and a half million, Joe. Why did he deserve three and a half million from Moscow? My family- My family lost a fortune by coming down and helping us with governance. Every single one of them lost a fortune- Chris, can I be honest? It’s a very important question- He stood up- … and the threatened Ukraine- … with a billion dollars- Well, and him too. Well, that’s all right, but he does plenty. He does plenty. Oh yeah, sure. That’s true. So- You did a crime bill, 1994, where you call them super predators. African-Americans are super predators and they’ve never forgotten it. They’ve never forgotten it. So you did that and they call you a super predator and I’m letting people out of jail now, that you have treated the African-American population community, you have treated the black community about as bad as anybody in this country. You did the 1990… And that’s why, if you look at the polls, I’m doing better than any Republican has done in a long time, because they saw what you did. You call them super predators, and you’ve called them worse than that. Because you look back at your testimony over the years, you’ve called them a lot worse than that. As far as the church is concerned and as far as the generals are concerned, we just got the support of 250 military leaders and generals, total support. Law enforcement, almost every law enforcement group in the United States. I have Florida. I have Texas. I have Ohio. I have every… Excuse me, Portland, the sheriff just came out today and he said, “I support President Trump.” I don’t think you have any law enforcement. You can’t even say the word law enforcement. Because if you say those words, you’re going to lose all of your radical left supporters. And why aren’t you saying those words, Joe? Why don’t you say the words law enforcement? Because you know what? If called us in Portland, we would put out that fire in a half an hour. But they won’t do it, because they’re run by radical left Democrats. If you look at Chicago, if you look at any place you want to look, Seattle, they heard we were coming in the following day and they put up their hands and we got back Seattle. Minneapolis, we got it back, Joe, because we believe in law and order, but you don’t. The top 10 cities and just about the top 40 cities are run by Democrats, and in many cases radical left. And they’ve got you wrapped around their finger, Joe, to a point where you don’t want to say anything about law and order. And I’ll tell you what, the people of this country want and demand law and order and you’re afraid to even say it. What is peaceful protest? When they run through the middle of the town- … and burn down your stores and kill people all over the place- . No it’s not, but you say it is. Fine. I ended it because it’s racist. I ended it because a lot of people were complaining that they were asked to do things that were absolutely insane. That it a radical revolution that was taking place in our military, in our schools, all over the place. And you know it, and so does everybody else. And he would know it-  If you were a certain person, you had no status in life. It was sort of a reversal. And if you look at the people, we were paying people hundreds of thousands of dollars to teach very bad ideas and frankly, very sick ideas. And really, they were teaching people to hate our country And I’m not going to do that. I’m not going to allow that to happen. We have to go back to the core values of this country. They were teaching people that our country is a horrible place. It’s a racist place. And they were teaching people to hate our country. And I’m not going to allow that to happen. You just don’t know. During the Obama-Biden administration, there was tremendous division. There was hatred. You look at Ferguson, you look at, or you go to very… Many places, look at Oakland. Look what happened in Oakland. Look what happened in Baltimore. Look what happened… Frankly, it was more violent than what I’m even seeing now. But the reason- … is that the Democrats that run these cities- … don’t want to talk, like you, about law and order. And you still haven’t mentioned. Are you in favor of law and order? Are you in favor of law and order?  Okay. It went down much more in ours. The places we had trouble were democratic run cities- I think as a party issue, you can bring in a couple of examples but if you look at Chicago, what’s going on in Chicago where a 53 people were shot and eight died shot, if you look at New York where it’s going up, like nobody’s ever seen anything. The numbers are going up a 100%, 150%, 200% crime, it is crazy what’s going on and he doesn’t want to say law and order because he can’t because he’ll lose his radical left supporters and once he does that, it’s over with. But if he ever got to run this country and they ran it the way he would want to run it, we would have by the way our suburbs would be gone. And you would see problems like you’ve never seen before. Oh, I know suburbs so much that you. That’s not what they are talking about this. That’s not what it is about. He’s talking about defunding the police. He doesn’t have any law support. He has no law enforcement. He has almost nothing. Oh, really, who do you have name one group that supports you name one group that came out and supported you. Go ahead. Think we have time. No, no think right now. Name one law enforcement group that came out in support of you. There aren’t any. He’s never done that. Oh really? I sent in the US Marshalls to get the killer of a young man in the middle of the street and they shot him for three days Portland didn’t do anything. I sent in the US Marshals they took care of business. I don’t know who said that. Who? I don’t think she said that. I don’t think so. Does it mean I have to answer his stuff. Wait a second, you have made a statement. I would love to end it. I’ll send in the National Guard, it would be over. That’d be no problem. But I don’t want to accept the National Guard. Sure, I’m will to do that. I would say almost everything I see is from the left wing not from the right wing. I’m willing to do anything. I want to see peace. What do you want to call them? Give me a name, give me a name, go ahead who do you want me to condemn. Proud Boys, stand back and stand by. But I’ll tell you what somebody’s got to do something about Antifa and the left because this is not a right wing problem this is a left wing… Oh you got to be kidding me. Well, then you know what, he’s wrong. Antifa is bad. You know what, Antifa is a dangerous radical group. And you ought to be careful of them, they’ll over throw you. Because there is never been an administration or president who has done more than I’ve done in a period of three and a half years. And that’s despite the impeachment hoax and you so what happened today with Hillary Clinton, where it was a whole big con job. But despite going through all of these things where I had a fight, both flanks and behind me and above there has never been an administration that’s done what I’ve done. The greatest, before COVID came in the greatest economy in history, lowest unemployment numbers, everything was good. Everything was going. And by the way, there was unity going to happen. People were calling me for the first time in years, they were calling and they were saying it’s time maybe and then what happened? We got hit. But now we’re building it back up again. A rebuilding of the military, including Space Force and all of the other things. A fixing of the VA which was a mess under him, 308,000 people died because they didn’t have proper health care. It was a mess. And we now got a 91% approval rating at the VA, our vets. We take care of our vets. But we’ve rebuilt our military. And I’ll tell you something, some people say maybe the most important by the end of the first term I’ll have approximately 300 Federal judges and Court of Appeals judges, 300 and hopefully three great Supreme Court judges, justices that is a record the likes of which very few people and one of the reasons I’ll have so many judges because President Obama and him left me 128 judges to fill. When you leave office, you don’t leave any judges. That’s like, you just don’t do that. They left 128 openings and if I were a member of his party, because they have a little different philosophy, I’d say, if you left us 128 openings you can’t be a good president. You can’t be a good vice president but I want to thank you because it gives us almost, it’ll probably be above that number. By the end of this term, 300 judges. It’s a record. You son got three and a half million dollars. Really? Are you talking Hunter, are you talking about Hunter. I don’t know Beau. I know Hunter. Hunter got thrown out of the military. He was thrown out dishonorably discharged. For cocaine use. And he didn’t have a job until you became vice president. Once you became vice president he made a fortune in Ukraine, in China, in Moscow and various other places. He made a fortune and he didn’t have a job. But why was he given tens of millions of dollars? I know but when somebody gets three and a half million dollars from the Mayor of Moscow. Why did he get it? I want crystal clean water and air. I want beautiful clean air. We have now the lowest carbon… If you look at our numbers right now, we are doing phenomenally. But I haven’t destroyed our businesses. Our businesses aren’t put out of commission. If you look at the Paris Accord, it was a disaster from our standpoint. And people are actually very happy about what’s going on because our businesses are doing well. As far as the fires are concerned, you need forest management. In addition to everything else, the forest floors are loaded up with trees, dead trees that are years old and they’re like tinder and leaves and everything else. You drop a cigarette in there the whole forest burns down. You’ve got to have forest management. I believe that we have to do everything we can to have immaculate air immaculate water and do whatever else we can that’s good. We’re planting a billion trees, the Billion Tree Project and it’s very exciting for a lot of people. I think a lot of things do, but I think to an extent, yes. I think to an extent, yes, but I also think we have to do better management o \n"

In fact, some of her biggest endorsers are very liberal people from Notre Dame and other places. So I think she’s going to be fantastic. We have plenty of time. Even if we did it after the election itself. I have a lot of time after the election, as you know. So I think that she will be outstanding. She’s going to be as good as anybody that has served on that court. We really feel that.

He’s in the Supreme Court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which will strip 20 million people from having health insurance now, if it goes into court. And the justice, I’m not opposed to the justice, she seems like a very fine person. But she’s written, before she went in the bench, which is her right, that she thinks that the Affordable Care Act is not Constitutional. The other thing that’s on the court, and if it’s struck down, what happens? Women’s rights are fundamentally changed. Once again, a woman could pay more money because she has a pre-existing condition of pregnancy. They’re able to charge women more for the same exact procedure a man gets."

Many people don’t want to hurt other people’s feelings, but it makes a big difference. It makes a gigantic difference in the way a child is able to grow up and have a sense of self-esteem. It’s a little bit like how this guy and his friends look down on so many people. They look down their nose on people like Irish Catholics, like me, who grow up in Scranton. They look down on people who don’t have money. They look down on people who are of a different faith. They looked down on people who are a different color. In fact, we’re all Americans. The only way we’re going to bring this country together is bring everybody together. There’s nothing we cannot do, if we do it together. We can take this on and we can defeat racism in American."
